Serving over 10,000 customers every day, CocoWater’s core goal is to expand their market share throughout the entirety of Vietnam. In addition, they desire to become the main competitor for large corporations within the beverage industry, such as Aquafina, Pepsi, and Lavie.\nThe firm’s CEO and founders respect the rapid development of technology and believe that a digital solution is the key to achieving their goals. A mobile app can be the heart of a business strategy to attracting new customers, expanding distribution networks, and optimizing shipping processes.\nWhat We Did\nAdamo has developed mobile apps aimed at serving customers, distributors, and shippers, as well as website for producers.\n\nThe platform allows customers to order CocoWater products from anywhere in Vietnam, letting them manage orders and view the estimated delivery time. Customers receive notifications for reservation orders and suggestions for placing new orders.\nNotifies shippers when a nearby order is available, and the app will automatically find the best route to efficiently connect stores and delivery addresses, saving both time and money.\nAllow distributors to control inventory and orders. Distributers can also manage liability with CocoWater monthly.\nProvides daily sales reports and distributor liabilities to the producer. They can also easily stay in touch with customers via the loyalty program.\n\nResults\nAfter launching, our mobile apps, and their ease of use  have greatly impressed users. It is the very first all-in-one app in Vietnam to integrate water orders, delivery, and inventory management, bringing about exciting new experiences to everyone. ",

        "description": "Background\nPremature birth occurs in about 8 to 14% of all pregnancies across the globe. But thanks to the recent advancements in both perinatal and neonatal care, premature infants have a higher chance of survival. After being discharged from the hospital, these infants live under the intensive care of their parents. But given the high risk of them suffering from medical complications, preterm infants require specialized treatment and support aside from  normal family care. The lack of appropriate medical care can also lead to a significant increase in complications, morbidity and mortality rates, as well as healthcare costs.\nWhat We Did\nThe Centre for Promotion of Advancement in Society (CPAS) cooperated with Adamo Digital to develop eBabyCare, a platform that provides intensive care services and enables in-house health monitoring for early complication detection for preemies, thereby giving premature infants the ideal conditions for normal growth and optimal health.\n\nParents’ assistant: Connects parents and doctors for regular advice via chat, phone calls, messages, and video calls regarding post-discharge care as well as health monitoring.\nDoctors’ assistant: Allows for the storage and update of health records, and creates reports about babies’ health and growth status. Doctors can monitor the preemies’ health as well as make re-examination appointments.\nHospital/clinics’ assistant: Manages and monitors patient volumes and online health services. eBabyCare also provides reports and forecasts about future demand.\n\nResults\nThis brand-new, easy-to-use IT application offers valuable features such as encouraging participation and interaction, content diversification, and visualization. By implementing recent technologies, this project promises replication at a low cost. Furthermore, issues regarding diseases with a high social impact that require special post-discharge care can easily be solved.",

And that makes a big difference for the budget.

Life is more convenient this way. You have more time to spend with your kids and do your own side projects. \nSioux developed a multi-platform application that offers equal functionality and looks & feels on all four supported platforms. The applications communicate with the customer's hardware through Wi-Fi and allow the end-user to view and edit the configurations of their lights, thermostats, automated actions, etc. The user interface was implemented in accordance with the specific graphic design, including animations and many custom controls.

The loyalty and engagement application is a great strategy to keep their customers engaged with Starbucks, offering unique features that are more engaging than Web by prompting both potential and current customers to engage, browse, shop and interact with Starbucks, with easily accessible information right at their fingertips.\nKyanon Digital has been helping Starbucks in 04 markets (Singapore, New Zealand, Vietnam and Cambodia) to develop and maintain their core digital capabilities: Rewards, Payment, Ordering and Personalization.\nChallenges\nStarbucks Singapore is finding a loyalty & engagement application to maximize their repeat sales.\nSolution\nKyanon Digital helps increase customer convenience and brand recognition by developing a loyalty and engagement application for Starbucks customers to fully access the services. Each mobile app account can actively track their loyalty program, promotions, store locations and manage their card and even customize occasional gift cards.\nThe Mobile app platform not only allows customers to order their customised favourite drinks but also serve as a loyalty program with digital card. The digital card allows customers to link a credit card, debit card, or mobile wallet to their account and pay directly for purchases and earn more rewards (stars) compare to the other direct payment method.\nImpact\nIn late 2021, the new version will be released which enables Starbucks customers to order food, beverages and signature merchandise with a click.\nFor every market, Kyanon will work closely with Starbucks to identify, select and integrate with different technology solutions to support the growth strategy of that market.\n ",

With constant effort in the improvement of paint’s protective functions and the creation of a large array of colours, Nippon Paint strives to meet and exceed customer expectations.\nGoals\nNippon Paint wanted to revamp their bilingual website (Vietnamese – English) to make it more professional and attractive.\nKey Challenges\n- Color coordinator function for each room: pick colors then click the wall to paint (https://nipponpaint.com.vn/en/colour-code/reds )\n- Colors and photos of paint from the old websites need to be kept.\n- Pay attention to the site speed because there are many designs of new colors, and photos of paint.\nOutcome\n- Following a CMS feasibility audit, we recommended our team build the website with Drupal. Drupal was selected due to its scalability, compatibility and sophistication with building secure, complex and content-rich websites at an enterprise level. We were able to apply Drupal’s layout builder modules to develop intuitive custom solutions.\n- Based on this recommendation, Nippon Paint decided to revamp their bilingue website (Vietnamese – English) to make it more professional and attractive using Drupal.\n- One of the highlights was the feature enabling visitors to see a demo of the selected color of paint (client’s product) right away on the example room/wall/house.",
