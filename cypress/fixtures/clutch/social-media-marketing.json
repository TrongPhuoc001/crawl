They didn’t like the copywriting on their old site, they wanted to rebrand, and they knew they needed help trying to help increase their sales. While the rebrand and redesign of the site were taking place, they knew they needed to support the operation of their site for optimal performance. \n\nWith our SEO site launch support, Bobo’s successfully launched their new site in 2018 and — unlike many eCommerce sites that undergo a site revamp — saw a marked increase in their traffic, rankings, and conversions. Traffic sessions to the site improved by 186% year over year and the newly launched blog brought in $1,630.57 of total revenue.\n\nThanks to optimization and proper keyword analysis, 274 conversions were managed between Direct Conversions and Assisted Conversions — totaling $7,547.41 from the blogs and recipes section of the new site alone. Bobo’s has also achieved growth in ranking for all targeted keywords, helping them corner more of the market’s attention in search. \n\nTo help illustrate the growth in organic keywords, here is a chart from SEM Rush showing the increase in the number of ranking keywords for eatbobos.com over the last 2 years with a box indicating when the new site launched in July of 2018."

Just contact us to get started."

        "des": "“Omega took hold of our outlet launch campaign firmly with two hands. Leaving mine free to drink a glass or two of beer.” - Tim Scott, CEO of BiaCraft Artisan Ales\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\n\nBiaCraft Artisan Ales historically struggled with generating local awareness of new outlet openings.\n\nWith ambitious expansion plans for the brand on the horizon, this problem had the potential to become even worse for BiaCraft in short time.\n\nRealizing this, Tim, the CEO, reached out to us for help with creating marketing campaigns for 2 new location launches beginning on November 1st & concluding on December 31st of 2018.\n\nThe best part:\n\nTim was more than happy to take a step back to focus on business operations while we did what we do best: build better brands.\n\nUNEXPECTED OBSTACLES\n\nOriginally, BiaCraft’s plan was to launch two new locations, both within District 1 of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nHowever, negotiations with the landlord of the 2nd location fell through at the very last minute.\n\nWhat was even worse:\n\nThis left us with only one week to completely redesign December’s campaign from the ground up for a new location in Tân Bình District.\n\nThe problem was the people of Tân Bình District had never heard of BiaCraft, let alone craft beer.\n\nThus, a completely different campaign strategy was necessary in order to pull off the kind of results we were achieving with November’s campaign.\n\nBut guess what?\n\nThanks to our laser focus on time-saving procedures, we were able to handle it.\n\nAnd handle it, we did.\n\nTHE SOLUTION\n\nBiaCraft’s brand can best be described as humorous, provocative, and as Tim says, “irreverant” – this is something we took to heart, and it features prominently in the content we created for these campaigns.\n\nBiaCraft already had a consistent presence on Facebook with organic engagement averaging near 4%, so we chose it as the primary channel for the marketing campaigns to amplify the impact of our campaigns.\n\nWe quickly identified 3 areas for improvement for BiaCraft:\n\n• None of their content was in Vietnamese, despite over 80% of their customer base being Vietnamese.\n\n• Virtually zero video content.\n\n• A lack of coordinated social media marketing campaigns – each post was different and unrelated to the next.\n\nThen, after performing our usual historical performance analysis, we determined that posts with Mark, the co-founder, performed better on average.\n\nThus, we decided to feature Mark heavily in our campaigns.\n\nCombining these findings with our mastery of the Facebook platform, we proposed something daring: two 3-week bilingual campaigns primarily consisting of humorous 6-second video ads in square & vertical format.\n\nShort-form video campaigns such as these are rare in Vietnam, and completely nonexistent within the country’s burgeoning craft beer industry.\n\nDon’t think we forgot about the challenge of Tân Bình District…\n\nIn order to engage our Tân Bình District audience on Facebook, we did 3 things:\n\n• Created a hyper-targeted audience by combining a Lookalike Audience with a Saved Audience.\n\n• Shot videos around familiar local landmarks Tân Bình District.\n\n• Created 2 contests to increase engagement & shareability of BiaCraft content, as well as attendance at the soft opening.\n\nBut here’s where the campaign got really interesting:\n\nWe decided to shoot and edit the entirety of these campaigns on an iPhone X to connect more intimately with BiaCraft’s fans through a raw, familiar content format.\n\nTim was more than happy to try it out and gave us the go-ahead.\n\nThe results speak for themselves.\n\nTHE RESULTS\n\nNUMBER OF POSTS\n\nNumber of posts from Omega campaigns: 22\n\nAVG. ENGAGEMENT RATE\n\nAVG. engagement rate per post from Omega campaigns: 8.5%\n\nWE DESIGN VIDEOS THAT ENGAGE YOUR AUDIENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nNumber of Videos: 14\n\nVideo Views: 155,000\n\nThruplays: 108,490\n\nAVG.

Given that the brand and the website itself is extremely image-focused, ensuring that the website remained true-to-brand and highly functional was a challenge. \n\nThroughout the build, performance remained a top priority. As such, additional functionality elements were custom coded giving users a vastly improved on-site experience including the ability to seamlessly add frames to their prints on the product page.\n\n \n\nAlthough the basis of the website refresh was achieved with an update to the Shopify theme, this project required a lot of heavy customisation which the theme did not offer to ensure that the site was on-brand and highly functional. \n\nWe also introduced new content sections to the website with information banners added above and below the fold on all custom collection pages. The inclusion of optimised content created space for us to harness new opportunities for SEO as well as create a filter to improve the conversion rate.\n\n \n\nTo ensure that we were able to harness the immediate benefits of these SEO opportunities, we optimised all the product pages, including the page titles and meta descriptions with relevant keywords and implemented internal linking across all the pages to increase user experience. \n\nWe were able to create a boutique-style site with an exceptional user experience that showcases their products in a sleek manner."

They’re also cheaper than any other provider available and believe in supporting small nurseries. \n \nAt the start of our partnership, TeachKloud underwent a website refresh to help increase conversions. Their brand was used almost exclusively as a resource rather than a sales tool to convert. TeachKloud initially approached The Good Marketer as they wanted to get off on the right foot with content creation for the new site.  \n \nTeachKloud initially had different marketing agencies handling other channels. However, they quickly realised that the most efficient way to work and achieve a successful, holistic strategy was to combine marketing activities. TeachKloud were so pleased with our content creation, transparency and communication that they brought their Paid Social action to The Good Marketer.\n \nSEO\nThe Good Marketer consulted on conversion rate optimisation. We implemented different paths for users to get in touch, such as the Live Chat function on the homepage.\n \nFrom no visibility at all, we have achieved position 1 for the most competitive key terms, “nursery management software” and “preschool management software” in the UK and Ireland.\n \nThe Results\nWhilst working on the TeachKloud campaigns, we were able to:\n \n\n\n\nIncrease clicks from Social channels by 99.74% to 41,001.\n\n\nDecrease the cost per lead by 82.33% from €180 to €31.81.\n\n\nGenerate 194 leads from no results at all.\n\n\nCreate and implement newly optimised landing pages.\n\n\nAchieve position 1 for the industry’s most competitive key terms.\n\n\nIncrease overall visibility in 2 countries.\n\n\nDrive a 162.22% increase in new users YoY.\n\n\nAchieve a 6 minute 39 seconds average session duration. \n\n\nCapture 1,277 goal completions."
